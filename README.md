# Python and R project templates

This repository holds templates that follow my typical workflow for new `python` and `R` projects.

**A word of caution**

These templates are mostly intended to save time. However, modern IDEs provide project templates that are more mature and less opinionated than the templates here. 

This repository serves an additional purpose of allowing developers new to programming to study project structure using very simple examples. 

For licenses, tests, and workflows, gitignore it is recommended that one generates these automatically either from their IDE of choice or for `.gitignore` files and licenses, via github or gitlab. 

Happy to hear from you in case of any questions and/or feedback.

Thank you,
