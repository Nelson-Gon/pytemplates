Changes in project version
==========================


* 
  For the install step, we now use ``pip install -e .`` in lieu of the now deprecated ``setup.py install`` and/or ``easy_install``. 

* 
  The ``install_requires`` field in ``setup.py`` is now automatically generated by reading each line in ``requirements.txt``. See `Issue #2 <https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/pytemplates/issues/2>`_. 

* We added support for some feature
* We fixed some bug(s). See link to some issue related to the bug.
